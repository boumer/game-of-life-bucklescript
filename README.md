This is a bucklescript port of my [game of life](https://github.com/tcoopman/game-of-life) implementation in elm.
I've used [tea](https://github.com/OvermindDL1/bucklescript-tea).

The port was mostly trival. The only issues I had were because of my limited knowledge of ocaml.

To run this:

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

And then serve the `release` folder.
